# Google Maps API Workshop

This workshop introduces participants to the practical application of Google Maps APIs for building robust, location-based services. Attendees will gain hands-on experience working with three core APIs:

üìçPlaces API ‚Äì Enables applications to search for places of interest based on geographic location, such as restaurants, landmarks, or businesses. Participants will learn how to retrieve detailed information including place names, categories, and more.

üìèDistance Matrix API ‚Äì Facilitates the calculation of travel distance and duration between origin and destination points. A useful addition into your application to see the distance & duration it takes to travel.

üó∫Ô∏èGeocoding API ‚Äì Allows applications to convert street addresses into coordinates, and coordinates back into readable addresses. This is essential for applications that require mapping, location tagging, or address validation.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of how to integrate these APIs into web or mobile applications, along with best practices for handling API requests and responses securely and efficiently.

### Step 2: Create a New Project
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. In the top-right corner, click on the **Select a Project** dropdown.
3. Click **New Project**.
4. Give your project a name (e.g., *Google Maps API Workshop*) and click **Create**.

### Step 3: Enable APIs
To use Google Maps services, you need to enable the APIs you'll be using. Here‚Äôs how:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
2. Search for and enable the following APIs (search individually for each):
   - **Geocoding API**
   - **Places API**
   - **Distance Matrix API**

### Step 4: Claim Your Free Credits Using a Coupon
If you are doing the workshop with GDSC you will claim the **coupon code** for free credits, follow these steps to redeem it:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Credits Redemption Page]([https://cloud.google.com/free](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/edu-grants#redeem) page.
2. Enter your First Name & Last Name.
3. **Enter the coupon code we give you during the workshop**.
   - Note: This coupon will only work if you use it on the Google Account you specified when you signed up for the event.
4. Your credits have now been successfully claimed. You may continue with the next step

   **Note**: You **do not need a billing account** if you're only using the free credits from the coupon.

### Step 5: Create API Key
Now you need to generate an API key to authenticate your application:

1. In the **APIs & Services** menu, go to **Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials**, then select **API Key**.
3. A pop-up will display your new API Key. Copy this key to use in your Python application.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out during the workshop!

## **Getting Started**
- Examples of how to use your project or APIs. Include code samples for how users can interact with the APIs or features of your project.

```python
import googlemaps

# Initialize the client with the API key
gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='your-api-key')
```
##  **Features**
A list of the key features or functionality the project provides, such as geocoding, distance matrix, places search, etc.

- Places API

```python
# ===================== Places API: Searching Nearby Locations =====================

# The `places_nearby` function finds nearby landmarks around the origin point.
# The location can be either:
#   - Latitude and longitude coordinates, or
#   - A human-readable address (which needs to be geocoded first).

# The `type` parameter specifies the type of places you are interested in (e.g., 'restaurant').

# Example: Search for nearby restaurants using coordinates (latitude, longitude)
location = (43.0617713, 141.3544507)  # Sapporo, Japan (latitude, longitude)
radius = 1000  # Search within a 1000-meter radius
place_type = 'restaurant'  # Searching for restaurants

# Fetch the nearby places
places_result = gmaps.places_nearby(location=location, radius=radius, type=place_type)

# Display the results
print("Nearby Restaurants:")
for place in places_result['results']:
    print(f"Name: {place['name']}")
    print(f"Address: {place['vicinity']}")
    print("-" * 40)
```
<br>
- Geocoding API

```python
address = "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500"

# Geocode the address
geocode_result = gmaps.geocode(address)

# Output the result
print("Geocoding Result:")
if geocode_result:
    for result in geocode_result:
        print(f"Formatted Address: {result['formatted_address']}")
        print(f"Latitude: {result['geometry']['location']['lat']}")
        print(f"Longitude: {result['geometry']['location']['lng']}")
        print("-" * 40)
```
<br>
- Distance Matrix API

```python
origin = "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500"  # Example origin address
destination = "The White House, Washington, DC"  # Example destination address
# Origin & destination can be either latitude and longitude coordinates or a human-readable address.

distance_result = gmaps.distance_matrix(origins=origin, destinations=destination, mode=driving)
# Mode can be set to walking, bicycling, transit or driving
distance_info = distance_result['rows'][0]['elements'][0]
print(f"Distance: {distance_info.get('distance', {}).get('text', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Duration: {distance_info.get('duration', {}).get('text', 'N/A')}")
```

##  **Starting our project**
We will be making use of what we just learnt earlier to make a simple fetch & search program.
* User Input: A location (e.g., a city name) is taken as input.
* Geocode the Location: Convert the location name into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
* Search Nearby Restaurants: Use the coordinates to find nearby restaurants.
* Use Distance Matrix: Calculate the distance from the origin (input location) to the restaurants.

```python
import googlemaps

# Initialize Google Maps client
gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# Geocode a human-readable location to coordinates
def geocode_location(location_name):
    geocode_result = gmaps.geocode(location_name)
    return geocode_result[0]['geometry']['location']

# Find nearby restaurants around given coordinates
def find_nearby_restaurants(location, radius=1000):
    # You could add more parameters like 'keyword' or 'rank_by' to filter results
    # For example, use 'rank_by="distance"' to get the closest restaurants
    result = gmaps.places_nearby(location=location, radius=radius, type='restaurant')
    return result.get('results', [])

# Main program
def main():
    location_input = input("Enter a location (e.g. Nanyang Polytechnic): ")
    origin_location = geocode_location(location_input)

    print(f"\nCoordinates: {origin_location}")

    nearby_restaurants = find_nearby_restaurants(origin_location)

    if not nearby_restaurants:
        print("No nearby restaurants found.")
        return

    print("\nNearby Restaurants:")
    for restaurant in nearby_restaurants:
        # Vicinity refers to the address of the location. For example: NYP's address is 180 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8, Singapore.
        print(f"- {restaurant['name']} ({restaurant['vicinity']})")
        
        # Calculate distance using your format
        mode = "driving"
        distance_result = gmaps.distance_matrix(
            origins=[origin_location],
            destinations=[restaurant.get("vicinity")],
            mode=mode
        )

        distance_info = distance_result['rows'][0]['elements'][0]
        print(f"  Distance: {distance_info.get('distance', {}).get('text', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"  Duration: {distance_info.get('duration', {}).get('text', 'N/A')}\n")

main()
```
